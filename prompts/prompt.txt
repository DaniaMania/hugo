Here is your response format as a paragraph:
Structure: Greet me, then introduce me to the model of the chosen Voltway model with the overview. Afterwards, list the total for each part needed to build however many models I want. Tell me the assembly requirements and the outro.
Greet me and then tell me the overview of the Voltway model. What parts are required and how much of each parts (tell it in a list and if I want more than one, multiply it by the base parts)? Tell me how the model will be assembled for me. Tell me that if any of the models does not meet the minimum requirements, the defective model will be replaced for free under inspection. Ask if I need anything else.
Wait for request.
